# Forms

## Key Concepts

- `Form`s are the core container of Proper forms, they are classes that group fields and connect them to models.

- Fields do most of the heavy lifting. Each field represents a data type and the field handles coercing form the input string to that datatype. They can also run validations on the values.

- A field isn't tied to a specific HTML tag, so can be presentend in multiple ways. Even the same form can be used in different contexts and have different widgets and styles on each.

- Many commonly used built-in validators, and you can also write simple functions to use as custom ones.

- Any field can accept multiple values; as a list or as a comma-separated text.

- All error messages are editable. We are not robots, the tone of the messages must be able to change or to be translated.


## Diving into it

This is an example of a simple form:

```python
# forms.py
from proper.forms import Form, Text, LongerThan


class MessageForm(Form):
    your_name = Text(required=True)
    message = Text(
        LongerThan(5, "Please write a longer message"),
        required=True
    )
```

And this is the same form connected to a Model:

```python
# forms.py
from proper.forms import SQLAForm, Text, LongerThan
from .models import db, Message


class BaseForm(SQLAForm):
    _session = db.scoped_session


class MessageForm(BaseForm):
    _model = Message

    your_name = Text(required=True)
    message = Text(
        LongerThan(5, "Please write a longer message"),
        required=True
    )
```

Our form has two text fields, both required. The second one has a validator to ensure that the value is longer than five characters. You can have several validators on each field.

There are three steps involved in using a form.

**[1] First**, we need to show the form to the user. Let's see it with an example in Flask. First, in your controller, we create a form instance using the input data and the existing object (that could be `None`, if it doesn't exist yet):

Controller:
```python hl_lines="15"
from flask import request, render_template
from .app import app
from .forms import MessageForm
from .models import db, Message


@app.route("/messages/new/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
@app.route("/messages/<int:msg_id>/edit/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def edit(msg_id=None):
    # Load the message if exists
    message = None
    if msg_id:
        message = db.query(Message).filter_by(id=msg_id).first()

    form = MessageForm(request.form, message)

    # TODO

    return render_template(
        "message_edit.html.jinja2",
        form=form,
    )
```

Template:
```html+jinja
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block title %}Edit message{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<form method="post" action="">
  <div class="form-group">
    {{ form.your_name.as_input(label="Name:") }}
    {{ form.your_name.render_error() }}
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    {{ form.message.as_textarea(label="Message:") }}
    {{ form.message.render_error() }}
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
</form>
{% endblock %}
```

**[2] Second**, we process the input data the user send using the form:

```python hl_lines="17 20 21"
from flask import request, render_template, redirect, url_for, flash
from .app import app
from .forms import MessageForm
from .models import db, Message


@app.route("/messages/new/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
@app.route("/messages/<int:msg_id>/edit/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def edit(msg_id=None):
    if msg_id:
        message = db.query(Message).filter_by(id=msg_id).first()
    else:
        message = None

    form = MessageForm(request.form, message)
    # [2]
    if request.method == 'POST' and form.validate():
        # [3]
        form.save()
        flash("Message saved.", 'success')
        return redirect(url_for("messages"))

    return render_template(
        "message_edit.html.jinja2",
        form=form,
    )
```

Note that we have it so validate() is only called if there is POST data. The reason we gate the validation check this way is that, when there is no POST data (like in step [1]), we don’t want to cause validation errors.

If the form was submitted and has errors, it'll be shown again to the user, only this time with error messages.

**[3] Finally**, if the form is valid, we do something with the data. In this example, `form.save()` creates/update a `Message` object in the database. After we finish processing the form, we do a redirect to another page.
